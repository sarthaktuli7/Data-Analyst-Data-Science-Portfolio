## Project Overview

This project features two comprehensive, interactive dashboards built using **Tableau** designed to empower sales managers, executives, and marketing teams with critical insights into sales performance and customer behavior. The dashboards facilitate data-driven decision-making by providing a clear, real-time overview of key metrics, trends, and comparisons, enabling stakeholders to identify opportunities, track progress, and refine strategies.

This project showcases robust skills in data visualization, business intelligence, data analysis, and dashboard design within the Tableau environment.

## üéØ Problem Statement

In many organizations, understanding the true pulse of sales performance and customer engagement can be obscured by disparate data sources and static reports. Sales and marketing teams often struggle with:

- **Lack of Real-time Visibility:** Difficulty in quickly grasping current sales trends and comparing them against historical performance.
- **Limited Customer Insight:** Insufficient understanding of customer segments, loyalty, and the profitability of individual customers.
- **Inefficient Data Exploration:** Manual data sifting and report generation, hindering agile decision-making.

This project addresses these challenges by consolidating key metrics into interactive, user-friendly dashboards, providing immediate access to actionable insights.

## ‚ú® Solution & Key Features

I developed two interconnected dashboards in Tableau to provide a holistic view of the business:

### 1. Sales Performance Dashboard

**Purpose:** To present an overview of sales metrics and trends to analyze year-over-year sales performance and understand sales dynamics.

**Key Features:**

- **KPI Overview:** Displays summary of total sales, profits, and quantity for the current year (CY) and previous year (PY).
- **Sales Trends:** Visualizes monthly sales, profit, and quantity trends for both CY and PY, with clear highlighting of months exhibiting highest and lowest sales.
- **Product Subcategory Comparison:** Compares sales and profit performance across different product subcategories, offering insights into product line health.
- **Weekly Trends:** Presents granular weekly sales and profit data for the current year, including average weekly values and highlighting weeks performing above or below average.

### 2. Customer Insights Dashboard

**Purpose:** To provide an overview of customer data, trends, and behaviors, helping marketing teams and management understand customer segments and improve customer satisfaction.

**Key Features:**

- **KPI Overview:** Summarizes total number of customers, total sales per customer, and total number of orders for CY and PY.
- **Customer Trends:** Shows monthly trends for customer-related KPIs (customers, sales per customer, orders) for both CY and PY, identifying peak/low months.
- **Customer Distribution:** Represents the distribution of customers based on the number of orders placed, providing insights into loyalty and engagement.
- **Top 10 Customers By Profit:** Identifies and details the top 10 most profitable customers, including their rank, number of orders, current sales, current profit, and last order date.

## üîó Design & Interactivity

Both dashboards are built with a focus on user experience and dynamic analysis:

- **Dynamic Year Selection:** Users can easily select any desired year from a filter to analyze historical data.
- **Seamless Navigation:** Intuitive navigation allows users to switch effortlessly between the Sales and Customer dashboards.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Charts and graphs are designed to be interactive, enabling users to click on elements to filter related data across the dashboard.
- **Comprehensive Data Filters:** Users can slice and dice data by various dimensions including product `Category`, `Subcategory`, and geographical information like `Region`, `State`, and `City`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Skills Demonstrated

- **Tableau Desktop:** For data connection, visualization design, dashboard creation, and interactivity.
- **Data Analysis:** Interpreting business requirements, defining KPIs, and extracting insights from raw data.
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** (Assumed pre-processing of raw data before Tableau import) Ensuring data quality and structure for effective visualization.
- **Business Intelligence:** Translating business questions into actionable dashboard components.
- **Data Visualization:** Designing clear, effective, and aesthetically pleasing charts and dashboards.
- **SQL (Optional/Implicit):** If data pre-processing involved database queries, this skill could be highlighted.
- **Requirements Gathering:** Ability to translate user needs into dashboard specifications.

## üöÄ How to Access and Use the Dashboards

To view and interact with these dashboards:

1. **Download Tableau Reader (Free) or Tableau Desktop:**
    - If you have Tableau Desktop, you can open the `.twbx` file directly.
    - If you don't have Tableau Desktop, download the free [Tableau Reader](https://www.tableau.com/products/reader) application.
2. **Download the Tableau Workbook:**
    - Locate the `.twbx` file (Tableau Packaged Workbook) in this repository (e.g., `Sales_Customer_Dashboards.twbx`).
    - Download this file to your local machine.
3. **Open the Workbook:**
    - Open Tableau Reader or Tableau Desktop.
    - Go to `File > Open` and select the downloaded `.twbx` file.

The dashboards will load, and you can begin exploring the data using the filters and interactive elements.

## üìÅ Project Files

The core project deliverable is typically a **Tableau Packaged Workbook (`.twbx`)** file, which includes both the dashboard definitions and the underlying data.

- `Sales_Customer_Dashboards.twbx` (This would be the actual file containing your Tableau project).
- `README.md` (This file)
